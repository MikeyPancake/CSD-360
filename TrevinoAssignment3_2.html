        <p>
            I was born on <span id = "birthday">_________</span> in Utica New York. I spent most of my childhood living on Bleeker Street and Walnut Street. 
            As a child, I enjoyed playing outside with my friends where we loved to play the game Manhunt, it is kinda like hide and go seek. 
            My mother and father separated when I was a young child so I lived with my mom mostly and spent time with my father on the weekends. 
            On the weekends my father loved to take me hunting and fishing where I grew an extreme dislike for <span id = "dislike">_________</span>. 
            My mother passed away when I was 11 so I moved in with my father where he raised me till i joined the Army.
        </p>

            I joined the US Army in 2005 at the age of 19. I was stationed at <span id = "base">_________</span> where I served as a Infantryman
            with the 82nd Airborne Division. While stationed at Fort Bragg, I deployed to many beautiful countries like <span id = "countries">
            _________</span>. I spent nine years at Fort Bragg before I went through additional training for the job a am currently in.
